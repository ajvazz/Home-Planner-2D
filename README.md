# Home Planner 2D

## :information_source: About
Home Planner 2D is a program which simulates building, creation and design of home interior.
In its core, it represents a creative way of reorganizing or planning your home.

The user can choose to start from arranging room layout by his own or use a default template scheme. With that pre-made base, the user can focus on furniture arrangement. In this stage, he can choose among a wide range of home equipment, many of which come in various colors. This selection is provided by furniture catalog, which is intuitively and categorically sorted.
